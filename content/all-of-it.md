Title: All of IT

For the past few months I've been actively searching and applying for different 
job positions and although is not my first time, I've came to realize the amount 
of knowledge most of the employers I interviewed with expected and it's dizzying.

First of all, _English_. This is a must have in every position I applied for. 
I guess this also comes from the fact that I only apply for this kind of positions 
because of my level of expertise on it I have a clear advantage against most of 
my peers in my country. On the other hand, not knowing English in IT is really
a big handicap.

Then, the list grows exponentially. I've been tasked for different exercises in the many interviews I had:

* SQL and NoSQL modeling and querying
* Data structures
* Complexity (Big-O)
* Recursion
* Bitwise manipulation
* Search/sort algorithms
* Flow charts
* Architecture
* Design patterns
* Programming paradigms
* Agile methodologies
* Unit testing
* Mocking
* Version control
* IDE and editors
* Operating systems commands (specially if you apply for Linux related jobs)

This is all _basic_ stuff _every_ developer with more than two years of professional 
experience has to know or at least is expected to know. And I might be leaving 
some other things behind.

Now you have to add **all** the specific knowledge of the technologies which are 
really used by the position. For example, if you're a front-end developer in 
2014 you're expected to have a deep knowledge of:

* HTML (X, 4, 5) and CSS (and LESS or SASS)
* JavaScript (and jQuery)
* SPA frameworks (Backbone, Angular, etc)
* Backend frameworks (Spring, Django, Symfony)
* Templates
* HTTP, REST, JSON, XML
* Authentication (Basic, OAuth, OpenID)
* Browsers quirks (will this work in MSIE?)
* Responsive design
* Localization
* GIS Positioning
* Data validation
* Basic security
* API and integration
* And more...

You also have to add business specific knowledge like insurance, travel, banking. Have 
worked in some open source project. Done all the exercises in Project Euler. Aren't you
overwhelmed yet?

Of course, you have to keep up with every new fad that comes up. If you're an 
iOS developer, you have to learn Swift. If you do Android, the differences 
between each API and hardware. Some knowledge of web (hybrid apps) doesn't come bad either.

And **all** of this, through out your 50 years of professional life, without forgetting what 
a Red-Black tree is and how to implement BFS recursively on it. Because it's not like it was
_invented_ after 2.000 years of the invention of mathematics. It's funny how many of the 
most "simple" data structures and algorithms have been invented in the last 50 years 
and you're expected to remember them randomly for each interview.

All of this got me to wonder: _is this amount of knowledge and expertise expected 
in other engineering fields?_. Is 
a mechanical engineer asked about elementary physics questions during interviews or given
a bunch of Lego to build a motor. Is a chemical engineer asked about the density of 
different elements and to produce in a whiteboard the chemical structure of caffeine?

_Is this amount of knowledge and expertise expected in other non-engineering fields?_

I'm in no way trying to be disrespectful of other fields and my questions arise more from
my ignorance on them (I have my head full of IT acronyms and abbreviations) than as
a biased comparison. But it's true that because of this
not that many people who start their career in the IT field keep doing it after 10 or 15 years
and more worrying, people with great skills simply don't want to get involved in it.
