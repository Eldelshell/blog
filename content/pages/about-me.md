## About me

I'm a software engineer with more than 10 years of experience in the field. Developing software since the age of 10 years old, my life has always revolved around software & technology in general. With a strong believe in open source software I have participated and developed  several public projects. 

On the professional side Iâ€™ve been involved in many different projects, including development, systems, architecture and lately my focus has resided in web, mobile platforms and SOA architectures.

### How did you get into programming?

I wanted to translate some Macintosh (Pascal?) games to Spanish.

### What programming language do you specialize in?

Java and Python. I'm also proefficient with Perl, Groovy, Bash and JavaScript.

### What are your hobbies?

Videogames, programming & my kids.

### What does Eldelshell comes from?

Read a joke in twitter that went something like:

>Q: How do you say "Linux user" in [Elvish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvish_languages)?
>
>A: Eldelbash (it's funny in Spanish)

So, it got me inspired and changed it to __Eldelshell__ which translates to "Thou who uses the shell".

## About the blog

### Has this always been your blog?

No, previously this blog was called _monocaffe_ and was/is hosted in [monocaffe.blogger.com](http://monocaffe.blogger.com) but after 5 years of waiting for it to evolve into a good platform I finally got fed up and decided migrate.

### Why there are no comments?

During the five years this blog was live in _blogger.com_ I only got like 30 comments. Page visits were fine, but comments were very low (and that's fine I'm not an active blogger making a business out of it).

On the other hand, adding comments would make the blog a little heavier for you to load and a little harder for me to maintain.

### What are you using?

This blog is made using Pelican, a modified version of the Pelican-Bootstrap3 theme, Markdown and Vim.

### How can I contact you with questions?

My twitter feed is probably the best place.
