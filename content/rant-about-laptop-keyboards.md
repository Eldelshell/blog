I've been looking to replace my old HP Compaq nc6320 for a few weeks now and it's almost impossible
to find a good laptop for me, who uses his laptop for 10 hours a day mostly developing software or
administering server.

## Wishlist

* Great keyboard
* 4:3 aspect ratio screen
* Frontal speakers
* Glossy screen
* No disc drive
* 3 or more USB3 ports
* DVI port
* No VGA port
* Cheap standard HD
* 6GB or more of memory

## Keyboards

It seems that the principal way of input of a laptop is the most degraded, because keyboards keep getting
crapier every year. Take for example Lenovo. I don't know when or who had the idea that function 
keys are useless and people are better served if now you had to press three different keys to 
close a window (Fn + Alt + F4). 

Lenovo also changed the position of the freaking __Fn__ key with the left __Ctrl__ key.
And this is sad because my first choice is always Thinkpads when buying a laptop. Not any more!

At least the quality is good, not great, but good. Not like the new Dell keyboards. If any of the keys
isn't missing after a few days, you're one of the lucky ones. And I'm not talking about the cheap Inspiron,
I'm talking about mid-range Latitude and high-end XPS models.

## Touchpads

Is it that hard to have an standard on this? Now you have those that scroll with two fingers or with the
right side, those who click by tapping and the ones you have to press down the whole touchpad, the plain
ones and the textured ones. My preferences are: plain with tapping and right side scrolling.

## Screens

Now that 16:9 is a standard for laptop maunfacturers, there's not much I can do about it but _hate_ it,
because this is the worst aspect ratio for programming where vertical space is much more useful than
horizontal one. But since everyone is doing it.

It's almost impossible to find glossy screens. Yes, I know they suck when using the laptop on exteriors,
but it's not like I do what I do on the beach. Most of the time I'm in a dark room with low light conditions
where the crisp of glossy screens are great.
