# Hi Pelican!

I've finally got tired of blogger.com, so I'll be migrating my
whole blog to [GitHub Pages](http://github.com/) using Pelican to build the site and 
Markdown to write the HTML.

Let's see how it goes in the future. But first, here's some code to
test how _Pygments_ handles Java source code.

```java
public static void main(String [] args){

}
```
