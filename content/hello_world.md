## Hi Pelican!

I've finally got tired of blogger.com, so I've migrated my
whole blog to [GitHub Pages](http://github.com/) using Pelican to build the site and 
Markdown to write the HTML.

## Blogger Sucks

I've been using _blogger.com_ since 2007 (7 years) and it has always been a pain to see how
ugly the blog looked like, how hard it was to add code snippets, what a mess of HTML the 
WYSIWYG editor created and what a crappy support for mobile phones it had.

But, I stuck with it because of the analytics, the comments system and that I had some google
results already indexed very high.

## Here comes Pelican

So I had enough of this crap from Blogger and decided to setup everything with Pelican and GitHub Pages.

### GitHub Setup

Hosting a blog in GitHub Pages is very easy, simply create a repository for your profile as explained [here]('https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages'). So, I created two repositories: 

* Eldelshell/blog for the source code
* Eldelshell/eldelshell.github.io for publishing

### Pelican Setup

Using Pelican is very easy, simply follow one of the tutorials. In my case I installed the Ubuntu packages for Pelican, Pygments and Markdown. Using the __quickstart__ script I created the default structure, configured some stuff, added the theme and was done with it.

## Migrating from Blogger

I didn't find any "migration tool" that would allow me to generate all the Markdown files for my posts from Blogger, so this is something I'm doing by hand. At the same time I'm doing some improvements, but keeping the same dates and removing some posts that I feel don't belong in the blog anymore.
