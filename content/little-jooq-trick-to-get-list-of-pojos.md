This took a little research. The idea is to obtain a List of POJOs generated by _jOOQ_ using the related DAO.

```java
// PostDao and Post are generated by jOOQ
 
@Autowired PostDao dao;
@Autowired DSLContext dsl;
 
public List<Post> findAllByIdAndActive(UInteger id, Boolean active){
    return dsl.selectFrom(POST)
        .where(POST.ID.eq(id))
        .and(POST.ACTIVE.eq(active))
        .fetch()
        .map(dao.mapper());
}
```
In this case, we generated the __PostDao__ and the __Post__ POJO with jOOQ's generator. 
The trick is to use the `mapper()` method defined in the DAO to generate
the List of __Post__ instead of __Result&lt;Record&gt;__.
